Clustering Pushpins in Windows Store Apps  This code sample provides a reusable library for clustering pushpins in Windows Store apps. Clustering is the process of grouping nearby pushpins together to declutter the map.

This version of the sample is a Win 8.1 version and a Windows 10 UWP App using the Windows 8.1 Map control. I am not yet done porting the sample to the new Win 10 Map control.

The original sample code was taken from https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/bing/Clustering-Pushpins-in-95fb729a/view/Discussions and was created by Ricky Brundritt, a Microsoft collegue.
